## AGI Research Ideas
- How can we make models improve by themselves and learn, with long memories and more autonomy that interact with each other and build social intelligence
- Does building super intelligence require physical interaction with the real world to build a good representation and abstraction?
- Models that can generate their own training data to improve themselves.
- Models that can fact-check themselves.
- Massive sparse expert models.
- World of bits problem being solved at OpenAI, controlling a computer using pixels/mouse/keyboard.

## Product R&D
- Be curious about overall system, figure out boundary of what causes improvements
- Assess perf on different levels. World has changed a lot compared to before
- Sometimes you might have to look at instructions generated by compiler, even if operations of somethings are O(1)
- Good programmers that can change something without breaking the overall system is what's needed to improve product
