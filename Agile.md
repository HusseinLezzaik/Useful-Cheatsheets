## Agile
- Keeping an agile management is key for project management, fixed weekly meetings are good for status updates. Otherwise, keeping meetings per demand is faster for work to get done.
- Matrix of tasks: Product Owners vs Management
- An engineer usually should focus only 8 weeks ahead on a project, and shouldn't spend more than that on a single project. (?)
- Keep dividing work into sprints, and watch out of overcomplicating things and wasting time on useless things.
