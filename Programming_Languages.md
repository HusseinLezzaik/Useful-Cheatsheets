## Types
- `Imperative`
- `Functional` like `Haskel`
- `Hardware` like `Verilog/VHDL`
- Machine Learning (`Software 2.0`)

## Languages to Learn
- Assembly -> C -> Python
- Haskel
- Verilog & VHDL to see how things run at the same time

## Statically-typed vs. Dynamically-typed Language
- In a statically-typed language, the type of a variable is determined at compile time, rather than at runtime. 
- This means that the type of a variable must be specified when it is declared, and the variable can only hold values of that type.
- In contrast, a dynamically-typed language like Python does not require you to specify the type of a variable when you declare it.

## Decorators
- Decorators wrap a function, modifying its behavior

## Imperative Programming Language
- Code describes a step-by-step process for a programâ€™s execution. This process is called the `control flow`
- Examples of imperative languages like `Java`, `C`, `Pascal`, `Python`, `Ruby`, `Fortran`, `PHP`

## Declarative Programming Language
- Declarative programming describes what you want the program to achieve rather than how it should run.
- You define the results you want a program to accomplish without describing its control flow. 
- Examples of declarative programming languages like `SQL`, `Miranda`, `Prolog`, `Lisp`, Many `markup languages (e.g., HTML)`

## OOP vs. Non-OOP Languages
- It's more a matter of how you write than what you can express
- Some people prefer to have a special syntax support for functionality, but that comes with much more complex language like C++
- Different systems will lead to different choices like mission-critical (`performance/correctness`) 

## C vs. C++
- `C++` standard is `1600+` pages while `C` is `700` => more difficult to prove your code from ground principles as you can do with `C`
- You might have to go to the `C standard` for some notions when using the `C++ standard`
- `C++` is a changing language, so different versions of the `compiler` are not necessarily `compatible`. This leads to problems at `build/deployment` time

## C++ vs. Java 
- C++ and Java differ in their platform dependency, memory management, and use of classes
- C++ is `platform dependent` and needs to be compiled on every platform
- Java is `platform-independent`. Once it's compiled into `bytecode` it can be executed on any platform

## Public vs. Private vs. Protected
- Public variables, are variables that are visible to all classes.
- Private variables, are variables that are visible only to the class to which they belong.
- Protected variables, are variables that are visible only to the class to which they belong, and any subclasses.
