## RL
- After the paper in 2015, it turns out that RL isn't really efficient in training NNs because it's relying on sparse rewards that are rare to get. It was a bit early. There's too many options, and starting from scratch.. because you don't understand how to read, write, understand pixesl, etc
- Now people are revisiting this.

## Debugging RL Hacks
- plot accumulated reward over all episodes
- plot evolution of the parameters of q-network

## Offline Reinforcement Learning
Offline RL is a re-emerging area of study that aims to learn behaviors using only logged data, such as data from previous experiments or human demonstrations, without further environment interaction.
