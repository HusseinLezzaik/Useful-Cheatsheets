The dashes and vertical bars create the structure of the table, while the colons are used to specify the alignment of the text in the cells. For example, a colon at the start of a line (:) indicates left-aligned text, a colon at the end of a line (:) indicates right-aligned text, and a colon on both ends (:) indicates center-aligned text.
